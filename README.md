## Introduction

This analysis is the final project for the Program and Scripting module in GMIT's H.Dip in data analytics in april 2020. 
The brief was to research the well known Fisher's Iris data set and to write documentation and code in Python to investigate it. 

The tasks were laid out as follows:

1. Research the data set online and write a summary about it in your README.
2. Download the data set and add it to your repository.
3. Write a program called `analysis.py` that:
* outputs a summary of each variable to a single text file,
* saves a histogram of each variable to png files, and
* outputs a scatter plot of each pair of variables.

The following is the results of this analysis and explains how the code written  in Python works. 

## Running the program

In order to run this analysis Python needs to be installed on your system. The program is run using the `analysis.py` program in command prompt. The program needs `Ã¬ris.csv` to be in the same repository to run correctly.
It will generate all of the plots shows in this readme along with the `iris_summaries.txt` document.

## Data Format 

The csv data was obtained from the following git hub reposityry in csv format [1]. It was complied from the origional data set published by the UCI machine learning repository [2]. This repository is a collection of databases used by teh machine learning community for the empirical analysis of machine learning algorithms. It was created by a number of graduates of the University of California Irvine in 1987.  
 
The following table shows a sample of the data as it is presented in the csv file. 


|number|sepal_length| sepal_width| petal_length | petal_width |    species|
|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|
|0             |5.1|          3.5|           1.4|          0.2|setosa|
|1             |4.9|          3.0|           1.4|          0.2|     setosa|
|2             |4.7|          3.2|           1.3|          0.2|     setosa|
|3             |4.6|          3.1|           1.5|          0.2|     setosa|
|4             |5.0|          3.6|           1.4|          0.2|     setosa|
|..            |...|          ...|           ...|          ...|        ...|
|145           |6.7|          3.0|           5.2|          2.3|  virginica|
|146           |6.3|          2.5|           5.0|          1.9|  virginica|
|147           |6.5|          3.0|           5.2|          2.0|  virginica|
|148           |6.2|          3.4|           5.4|          2.3|  virginica|
|149           |5.9|          3.0|           5.1|          1.8|  virginica|

This table was then imported into python using the pandas module as described below. 

#### Modules and data imported

The initial set up of teh program required importing modules and the data to python as shows in teh code below: 

````
# Import necessary modules to python
import numpy as np 
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Import data
df = pd.read_csv("iris.csv")
````
The modules imported have the following functions:
* numpy - allows fast and efficient operations on arrays of data.  [4]
* pandas - provides high performance data structures and data analysis tools. [5]
* matplotlib - a comprehensive library for creating static, animated and interactive visualisations in Python. [6] 
* seaborn -  a data visualisation libary based on matplotlib. provides highlevel interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. [7] 


# Main Body

The following is a quick analysis of the iris data set. It's purpose is to demonstrate a a wide array of python techniques for data analysis along with providing a method for classifying the species in the data using vidual means. 



### Length vs width scatter plots

To begin with a simple length vs. width scatter plot for both the petal and sepal measurments was plotted. 
These plots show all of the data with no differentiation of species. Its gives a good idea of how similar the data is across all species of iris studied. 

#### Petal Length Vs. Petal Width

In order to produce the petal elngth vs petal width plot the following code was used:
````
plt.scatter(df['petal_length'], df['petal_width'])
plt.title("Petal length vs. Petal width")
plt.xlabel("Petal Length")
plt.ylabel("Petal Width")

plt.savefig("all_petal_length_vs_petal_width.png")
plt.clf()
````
It uses the scatter function of matplotlib to plot the petal length vs with imported from the data using teh df function. It is then appropiatly labelled and saved to the curent repositry. The `plt.clf()` command is then used to ensure the plot is clear for the next command.

#### Sepal Length Vs. Sepal Width


plt.scatter(df['sepal_length'], df['sepal_width'])
plt.title("Sepal length vs. Sepal width")
plt.xlabel("Sepal Length")
plt.ylabel("Sepal Width")

plt.savefig("all_sepal_length_vs_sepal_width.png")
plt.clf()
